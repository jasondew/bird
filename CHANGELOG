v0.0.14
better "bird" command, thanks to @jasondew. "bird hatch MyApp" for a new app; "bird help" or "bird --help" for more info.

v0.0.13
'bird nest' now cleans up after itself. 

v0.0.12 
`mime` and `header` methods available for your get/post/put/delete function bodies. 

e.g.:
  
  get [] = do
    body "Hello, World!"
    mime "text/plain"
    header "X-Powered-By" "bird"

v0.0.11
Your application code just got simpler. bird MyApp and check it out. 'get [] = body "Hello World"' constitutes a complete and valid bird app.

v0.0.4
Using "Rallod" for forward function application.

v0.0.3
Hack.Handler.Happstack is now the default hack server handler. 
Also, "bird build" has been replaced with "bird nest" and "bird run" with "bird fly"

v0.0.2
added support for query string. it's accessible in the request record from "params". 
it's a Data.Map. 
e.g.: 
  > module Blog where
  > import Bird
  
  > get, post, put, delete :: Request -> IO Reply
  > get r = ok $ "query string = " ++ (show $ params r)
  > post _ = return notFound_
  > put _ = return notFound_
  > delete _ = return notFound_
